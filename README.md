# Odds-Scrapper

This is a small experiment of implementing Selenium and Playwright to scrape data from betting sites in Panama.
This codes could be modified to write over a CSV to obtain how odds change in a time series. Also you could compare and found out which site offers better prizes. :)

Dependencies:
* Playwright V:1.37.0
* Selenium V:4.11.2
